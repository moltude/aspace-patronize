aspace-patronize
================

mobile application for the rapid digitization of archival collections by reading room patrons.

Goals
=====

Allow patrons to photograph collection materials and link them to EAD-encoded archival metadata using ArchivesSpace API. 

Use existing smartphone technologies to make this process intuitive to users.

Help users manage the masses of digital images they accumulate during a research trip.

Give the repository a choice to either make these images avalable to other patrons, or offer the application as a personal organizing tool for images that will not or should not be shared.

Encourage a climate of decreased risk-aversion around copyright and serving images on the web.
